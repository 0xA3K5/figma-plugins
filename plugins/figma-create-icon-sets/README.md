# Create Icon Sets
## Get it on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1349378343489934738/Create-Icon-Sets)

It's dead simple. 
select frames -> run the plugin -> save hours.
neatly organizes the component sets and sorts them alphabetically.

### How it works:
frame names *must* include at least one "/" and anything before is used to group the components. 

`"arrow-right/filled"`

`"arrow-right/outline"`

gets combined into `"arrow-right"` component set with the property values "filled" and "outline"
